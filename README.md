Meal Planner Application
A full-stack Meal Planner web application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose, and Svelte.js. The application allows users to create personalized meal plans by searching and adding meals from the Spoonacular API. It incorporates secure authentication, dynamic meal visualization, and persistent storage.

**Features**

User authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Search for meals using the Spoonacular API based on user preferences

Create, view, update, and manage personalized meal plans

RESTful API design for efficient server-client communication

MongoDB integration with Mongoose schemas for users and meal plans

Dynamic and responsive frontend developed with Svelte.js

Layered backend architecture following best practices

**Tech Stack**

Node.js, Express.js (Backend)

MongoDB, Mongoose (Database)

Svelte.js (Frontend)

Spoonacular API (Meal Data)

JWT (Authentication)

**Project Structure**

The project was built incrementally across three phases:

Homework 1: Developed a Node.js server with RESTful API routes and integrated the Spoonacular API using mock user and meal plan data.

Homework 2: Added JWT authentication, connected to MongoDB using Mongoose, and refactored the backend to use a layered architecture design.

Homework 3: Created a complete Svelte.js frontend connected to the Node.js backend, enabling users to interact with the application through a browser interface.
